# NADNet
A lightweight and effective neuron attention CNN for image denoising (NADNet) by Jibin Deng*, Chaohua Hu has been submitted to Signal, Image and Video Processing, 2024.
 
# Prerequisites:
python == 3.6.2

tensorflow == 2.0.0

keras == 2.3.1

opencv-python == 4.5.5.62

scikit-image == 0.17.2

# Denoising Training
For train the NADNet, please run:

python mainimprovement.py

# Denoising Testing
**The pretrained models have been uploaded to the folder "pretrained_models".**

For test the NADNet, please run:

python mainimprovement.py --pretrain sigma (e.g., 15, 25 and 50)/model_50.h5 --only_test True
